  - There should be four columns starting at `1024px`
  - There should be three columns starting at `768px`
  - There should be two columns starting at `488px`
- Gap between cards should be `48px`
- Do not modify header
- Blocks should start from the left


## Requirements:
- write styles in `src/styles/main.scss`
- use SCSS in this task
